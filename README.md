# Hizra-Tahir
I’m a passionate botany student currently pursuing my degree at GCWUS. Fascinated by plant biology, gymnosperms and environmental sustainability.I enjoy learning how plants shape ecosystems and impact human life.

I’ve participated in fieldwork, herbarium studies, and small-scale research projects and I’m always looking to expand my knowledge through hands-on experience. I'm particularly interested in plant conservation, ethnobotany, and biodiversity.

I’m eager to connect with professionals, researchers, and fellow students in the plant sciences, and open to internship and research opportunities that will help me grow in the field of botany.
